# Supervised Learning Project 1

This project focuses on implementing different regression models on toy datasets. The source code is 
provided in the two Jupyter Notebooks ``part_1.ipynb`` and `part_2.ipynb`.

`Report.pdf` provides a detailed explanation of this entire project.

`results` contains the plots generated for all experiments performed.

* NumPy == 1.18.5
* Seaborn == 0.11.0
* MatPlotLib == 3.3.2
